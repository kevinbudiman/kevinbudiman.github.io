How is it that the one percenters can continue to milk the cash cow with no thought for an end game? The business model of squeezing the lower classes is not sustainable. I know global business leaders don't lack vision. Do they just not care? Is acquisition of wealth a goal in itself? Why?
</p>

<p>
Resource rapine must be fun while it lasts. I wouldn't know. But without rebuilding the middle class to pump more money into the economy the resources are finite, and the under class won't be satisfied with bread and circuses forever. I saw a woman in a wheel chair hoist herself up on the side of a dumpster, legs dangling limply, so she could rummage for food, aluminum cans, etc. What kind of world, what kind of America is that?
</p>

<p>
Edit: this kind of blew up, and I'm grateful for the discussion. But to answer my own question, I think there's a few of things going on: gluttony, sociopathy, and functional fixedness.
</p>

<p>
Gluttony, because avarice seems to be an end onto itself, and because the "haves" control the corporations which are required by law to maximize profit for the shareholders.
</p>

<p>
Sociopathy because the "haves" got theirs and "devil take the hind most," however short sighted that is.
</p>

<p>
Functional fixedness, because it's easier to rape resources and milk the cash cow than it is to consider a triple bottom line, easier to care about and focus on the single metric of profit, rather than concern themselves with any long game of protecting the consumers of their products and services, the sources of their raw materials, or the environment, especially when it pushes up against their sole metric.
</p>

<p>
I in part blame government, not because it's not giving handouts to the "have nots" but because it has failed to adequately regulate business.
</p>

<p>
I partly blame business schools who have failed to adapt curriculum to a shifting world view, culture, and economy.
</p>

<p>
And I partly blame the media for reasons which should be obvious, RIP the fourth estate.
</p>

<p>
And I partly blame "the have nots" for letting it all happen, though really, we're just a frog in the pot set to boil.
</p>

People don’t like paying taxes - independent of status. However, in the past, there was an important reason to fully fund social programs - humans were useful. The industrialists needed literate and healthy workers and did not want to solely own the burden of providing education and health services for them. The state needed well trained and healthy soldiers and administrators. You also had a strong wave of socialism spreading through industrialized nations which incentivized capitalists to pony up a bit more for social programs. Today, industry and armies increasingly require far fewer individuals, leading to a dramatic increase in the number of “useless” humans. In the near future, with continued automation and development of ever smarter AIs, the number of people with no real use to society will grow dramatically. Combine this with the collapse of almost every socialist state, and you remove almost all incentive to fund state social programs. Since the wealthy see their taxes as largely paying for these services, and since they no longer benefit in the same way they used to, you see a desire on their part to dismantle state social programs and reduce their tax bill. The folly of course being when you have a dystopian society with a very few haves and a great many have-nots, the haves often times end up losing their heads.
