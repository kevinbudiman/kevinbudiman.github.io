</p>

<p>
<ol type="1" start="11">
<li>Insurance</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
Take on the risk of some specific bad thing happening to the policy holder in exchange for a predefined series of payments, then pay out claims only when the bad thing actually happens.
</p>

<p>
<ol type="1" start="12">
<li>Capital</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
Purchase an ownership stake in a business, then collect a corresponding portion of the profit as a one-time payout or ongoing dividend.
</p>

<p>
 TO CREATE A SUCCESSFUL SERVICE, YOUR BUSINESS MUST:
</p>

<p>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>Have employees capable of a skill or ability other people require but can’t, won’t, or don’t want to use themselves.</li>
<li>Ensure that the Service is provided with consistently high quality.</li>
<li>Attract and retain paying customers.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
TO CREATE A SUCCESSFUL SHARED RESOURCE, YOU MUST:
</p>

<p>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>Create an asset people want to have access to.</li>
<li>Serve as many users as you can without affecting the quality of each user’s experience.</li>
<li>Charge enough to maintain and improve the Shared Resource over time.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
The tricky part about offering a Shared Resource is carefully monitoring usage levels.
</p>

<p>
Finding the sweet spot between too few members and too many is the key to making a Shared Resource work.
</p>

<p>
TO RUN A PRODUCT-ORIENTED BUSINESS, YOU MUST:
</p>

<p>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>Create some sort of tangible item that people want.</li>
<li>Produce that item as inexpensively as possible while maintaining an acceptable level of quality.</li>
<li>Sell as many units as possible for as high a price as the market will bear.</li>
<li>Keep enough inventory of finished product available to fulfill orders as they come in.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
TO CREATE A SUCCESSFUL SUBSCRIPTION, YOU MUST:
</p>

<p>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>Provide significant value to each subscriber on a regular basis.</li>
<li>Build a subscriber base and continually attract new subscribers to compensate for attrition.</li>
<li>Bill customers on a recurring basis.</li>
<li>Retain each subscriber as long as possible.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
The key to Subscription offers is doing everything you can to keep customer attrition as low as possible.
</p>

<p>
TO PROVIDE VALUE AS A RESELLER, YOU MUST:
</p>

<p>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>Purchase a product as inexpensively as possible, usually in bulk.</li>
<li>Keep the product in good condition until sale - damaged goods can’t be sold.</li>
<li>Find potential purchasers of the product as quickly as possible to keep inventory costs low.</li>
<li>Sell the product for as high a markup as possible, preferably a multiple of the purchase price.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
Resellers are valuable because they help wholesalers sell products without having to find individual purchasers.
</p>

<p>
As long as an asset is durable enough to survive rental to another person and return ready for reuse, you can Lease it.
</p>

<p>
IN ORDER TO PROVIDE VALUE VIA A LEASE, YOU MUST:
</p>

<p>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>Acquire an asset people want to use.</li>
<li>Lease the asset to a paying customer on favorable terms.</li>
<li>Protect yourself from unexpected or adverse events, including the loss or damage of the leased asset.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
TO PROVIDE VALUE VIA AGENCY, YOU MUST:
</p>

<p>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>Find a seller who has a valuable asset.</li>
<li>Establish contact and trust with potential buyers of that asset.</li>
<li>Negotiate until an agreement is reached on the terms of sale.</li>
<li>Collect the agreed-upon fee or commission from the seller.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
“So long as there’s a jingle in your head, television isn’t free.” - Jason Love, marketing executive
</p>

<p>
TO PROVIDE VALUE VIA AUDIENCE AGGREGATION, YOU MUST:
</p>

<p>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>Identify a group of people with common characteristics or interests.</li>
<li>Create and maintain some way of consistently attracting that group’s attention.</li>
<li>Find third parties who are interested in buying the attention of that audience.</li>
<li>Sell access to that audience without alienating the audience itself.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
TO PROVIDE VALUE VIA LOANS, YOU MUST:
</p>

<p>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>Have some amount of money to lend.</li>
<li>Find people who want to borrow that money.</li>
<li>Set an interest rate that compensates you adequately for the Loan.</li>
<li>Estimate and protect against the possibility that the Loan won’t be repaid.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
TO PROVIDE VALUE VIA OPTIONS, YOU MUST:
</p>

<p>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>Identify some action people might want to take in the future.</li>
<li>Offer potential buyers the right to take that action before a specified deadline.</li>
<li>Convince potential buyers that the Option is worth the asking price.</li>
<li>Enforce the specified deadline on taking action.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
Concert tickets, coupons, retainers, and licensing rights are all examples of Options.
</p>

<p>
In exchange for a fee, the purchaser has the right to take some specific action - attend the show, purchase an asset, or buy a financial security at a particular price - before the deadline.
</p>

<p>
Options are valuable because they allow the purchaser the ability to take a specific action without requiring them to take that action.
</p>

<p>
Options are often used to keep specific courses of action open for a certain period of time before another transaction takes place.
</p>

<p>
Options are often an overlooked form of value - flexibility is one of the Three Universal Currencies. Find a way to give people more flexibility, and you may discover a viable business model.
</p>

<p>
TO PROVIDE VALUE VIA INSURANCE, YOU MUST:
</p>

<p>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>Create a binding legal agreement that transfers the risk of a specific bad thing (a “loss”) happening from the policy holder to you.</li>
<li>Estimate the risk of that bad thing actually happening, using available data.</li>
<li>Collect the agreed-upon series of payments (called “premiums”) over time.</li>
<li>Pay out legitimate claims upon the policy.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
“Capital is that part of wealth which is devoted to obtaining further wealth.” - Alfred Marshall, economist and author of principles of economics
</p>

<p>
TO PROVIDE VALUE VIA CAPITAL, YOU MUST:
</p>

<p>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>Have a pool of resources available to invest.</li>
<li>Find a promising business in which you’d be willing to invest.</li>
<li>Estimate how much that business is currently worth, how much it may be worth in the future, and the probability that the business will go under, which would result in the loss of your Capital.</li>
<li>Negotiate the amount of ownership you’d receive in exchange for the amount of Capital you’re investing.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
A homeowner may be willing to pay a maximum one-time fee of $50 for a pool cleaning kit, but they’d be willing to pay $250 a month to have someone clean their pool every week for them. The pool gets cleaned either way, but the weekly cleaning service has a higher perceived value because the pool owner doesn’t have to spend any time or effort to get the same desired result.
</p>

<p>
COMBINATIONS:
</p>

<p>
Travel Web sites like Orbitz sell Products (airplane tickets) alongside trip-cancellation Insurance, and display advertising (Audience Aggregation) to Web site visitors.
</p>

<p>
Movie theaters combine movie showings (a Shared Resource ) with tickets (an Option) and concession sales (Products).
</p>

<p>
In most companies, each of these offers is handled separately, and the customer can pick and choose which offers they want to take advantage of.
